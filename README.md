# Build a SwiftUI App that stores data in MongoDB Atlas using Atlas Device Sync

In this hands-on lab you will add to our existing habits application the hability to sync data to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. If you haven't done it yet, go to the Lab [SwiftUI Atlas Device SDK App Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/swiftui-atlas-device-sdk-app-lab/)

ðŸš€ Try it [here](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/swiftui-atlas-sync-app-lab/)

This repo contains the Docusaurus source code and documents needed to build the lab website. You can learn how we use Docusaurus in this [lab](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/docusaurus-workshop).

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
